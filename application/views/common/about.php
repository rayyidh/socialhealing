    	<h3>Social Healing</h3>
<p>
	Social healing is an emerging field that seeks to deal with wounds created by conflict, collective trauma and large-scale oppression. It seeks to identify areas of collective experience, which remain unresolved, neglected and repressed within the psyche of groups and even nations. Its domain is centrally within consciousness rather than politics per se; it is psycho-spiritual in nature and only activist in its consequences. Its primary modalities are truth, reconciliation, forgiveness and restorative justice. It requires individuals to assume the responsibility to become healing agents themselves and as such it is experiential rather than ideological.
